After some preliminary business, the meeting broke into Core and Library \u201cworking groups.\u201d Since exception safety was mostly a library issue, I stayed with the library group, of which Beman was the chair.\\n\\nBeman started by asking me to join the other members in the center of the room and filling me in on the job at hand: working through issues people had reported with the draft C++ standard. That was my first indication of the extraordinarily inclusive tone he set for these meetings. Everyone, and every idea, was treated with collegial respect, and the spirit of openness and contribution flowing from Beman had clearly \u201cinfected\u201d the other participants. I cautiously made a few points, which were greeted with appreciation, where I thought I could contribute.\\n\\nI left that meeting with the realization that it was possible to work together in a way I had never experienced in my regular job, driven by consensus, and that this spirit both raised the level of discourse, and produced better results, than what I had seen before. It put the lie to the disparaging phrase \u201cdesigned by committee.\u201d So when Beman proposed that we start the Boost Libraries project, I was immediately on board. His idea for Boost would blossom into a unique community of collaborative library designers because of the example he set.\\n\\nAs we grew Boost over the years, so grew our friendship, and when Beman passed away suddenly in 2020, it was a great loss to me personally, and, I think, to the world of programming. Beman never sought the spotlight, and I always wondered what would become of his contribution, which was surely underappreciated. That\u2019s why I was so thrilled to hear that a modern C++ libraries project was being launched in his name. May it continue to demonstrate Beman\u2019s commitment to community and excellence.\\n\\n![A photo of Beman Dawes](./beman.png)"}]}}')}}]);
